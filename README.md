# About
This project lets a user create a simulation of gravitational bodies in relation to eachother, such as galaxies or planetary systems, using Rust and WASM running on a server accessible from an internet browser.

# Get started!

## Run dev server locally

1. Install wasm-pack: https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/
2. Go to `wasm-project` directory: `cd wasm-project`
3. Build wasm: `npm run build:wasm`
4. Install npm dependencies: `npm i`
5. Run dev server: `npm start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
